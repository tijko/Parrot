setup more error handling/logging & commenting
log on interrupt signal
log on methods called
how many clients connected?

more detailed signal data passed (i.e. file name, type of access)
    [on this signal data] :: have a protocol? 
                    ==-- DBUS HANDLES THIS PROTOCOL --== (nice thought though if this were under some independent ipc method)        
        - where there is a timestamp and other meta data about the change and specific file.

different kind of events --> signals
    different signals to different events
    logging of each specific event
