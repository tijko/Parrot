systemd timesout d-feet

closing connections -- pass a struct of ParrotObject (GObject) and the mainloop instance
                       so cleanup can be made on signal

forking -- when done with one fork (only one process is being created but, several threads used)
           with two forks no process.  Systemd ends the process and with one forking happends?

Hash table of connections and other data


setup more error handling/logging & commenting
log on interrupt signal -> how many clients are assigned to receive a signal?
log on methods called

more detailed signal data passed (i.e. file name, type of access)
    [on this signal data] :: have a protocol? 
                    ==-- DBUS HANDLES THIS PROTOCOL --== (nice thought though if this were under some independent ipc method)        
        - where there is a timestamp and other meta data about the change and specific file.

different kind of events --> signals
    different signals to different events
    logging of each specific event

properties???
